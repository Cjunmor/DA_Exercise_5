```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, dev = "png",  dpi = 100)

```

## Exercises
Save all the graphics in the folder “results” in png format with a resolution of 100 dpi.

### Exercise 1
For the data InsectSpray, make a table for the number of insects for each spray with the mean, median and standard error.

```{r}
for (i in levels (as.factor(InsectSprays$spray))){
  SS <- subset.data.frame(InsectSprays, subset = InsectSprays$spray == i)
}
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
knitr::

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
